# easter-egg-valentine

This vuejs powered webapp is a quick project I've created as an exercise with vuejs framework and javascript. 
The concept behind the app is to display a random citation created by my friend Serena. 

The app is still in development and maybe some cool stuff will be added to the deployed heroku app
